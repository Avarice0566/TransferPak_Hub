# TransferPakHub

This repository provides a standalone Transfer Pak hub PCB designed to fit inside an N64 DexDrive case.  

## Requirements
- Transplant all surface-mount and DIP components from an **N64 controller PCB** (model: `CFS8120-200010-00`).  
- Optionally, add a **1.8mm LED** with the appropriate resistor to utilize the DexDrive caseâ€™s LED diffuser.
- Digikey Part No. SW1139-ND can be used to plug the DC jack hole in the dexdrive case

## Notes
- All DIP components are mounted on the opposite side of the board for clearance.  
- **Use at your own risk.** I am not responsible for any damage to your N64, its accessories, or your Game Boy cartridges.
